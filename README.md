## Description
My project Pixel Paint is a pixel art drawing program. Its simple, however, its simplicity is its strength,
as it serves the role of being an easy quick to launch program for quick sketches and ideas. It can be usefull
to different types of artists and can have its place even in professional enviornments. Its use can extend
outside of pixel art, allowing for anything that can be accomplished with a grid and pixels, like simple level
layouts. Overall the program can be versatile in its use.

The program is contained within one python file. It consists of a fullscreen application that has a white canvas
divided into many pixels. If the user presses on a pixel using the mouse it will become colored. There are a total
of ten colors that can be used which can be selected using the number keys. The colors are black, white, red, green,
blue, yellow, brown, orange, purple and pink. There is text on screen explaining which key corresponds to what color
and text displaying what color is currently selected.

A few considerations went into my design. The first was to make sure that the background of the program and the canvas
were different colors so that they didnt blend together. I also made sure that all the pixels were outlined so that the 
user is able to tell where each individual pixel is. The text was also a design consideration, as the user needs to know
how to select different colors and what color they currently have selected. 

There are a few directions I can take for future improvement. I could add different canvas sizes, tools for drawing,
more colors and other settings that will allow the program to fit individual user needs. I could also add features that
allow users to save their work and export completed drawings.
