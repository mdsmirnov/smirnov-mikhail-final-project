# Title
Pixel Canvas

## Repository
https://github.com/mdsmirnov/smirnov-mikhail-final-project.git 

## Description
My project will be a pixel drawing program. It will consist of a canvas divided into squares that can be colored with mouse clicks. 
It could potentialy be applicable as a simple pixel sprite creation tool for quick sketches/ideas.

## Features
- Divided canvas
	- Possibly done using draw to create a screen that is split into small squares
- Coloring squares
	- Using a mouse key down input to change the color values of the squares
- Keyboard inputs change selected color
	- Using key down inputs
- Text on the screen that says which color is selected
	- Possibly done with draw/font

## Challenges
- I will need to research and learn how to divide the screen into individual squares that can be changed
- I will need to learn more about mouse inputs
- I will need to research and learn how to create text on screen

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A program with all features stated above, done in a visually appealing and well working manner.
- If there is still plenty of time upon completion, and it is possible to do so, maybe even find a way to add a feature that can save your work as an image.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A program that can achieve the stated features, but in a more visually simplistic way.
- If things get too difficult, maybe even consider cutting a feature like the text display of current color.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Goal 1: Have a fullscreen 1920x1080 that is divided into small squares
  2. Goal 2: Make the code in a way that allow for the manipulation of color of each square

- Week 2
  1. Goal 1: Add mouse inputs
  2. Goal 2: Have a square chaange color if its clicked on

- Week N (Final)
  1. Goal 1: Add feature where certain keyboard inputs change the selected color
  2. Goal 2: Add text on screen that says the currently selected color
